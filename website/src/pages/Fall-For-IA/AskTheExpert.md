## How does it work?

The live broadcast will have a moderated chat session where you can submit questions in real time. We also have a custom [üé§ **Ask The Expert**](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues/new?assignees=&labels=ask+the+expert&template=---ask-the-expert-.md&title=%5BAsk+The+Expert%5D++) issue you can use to submit questions ahead of time as mentioned earlier.

* **We strongly encourage you to submit questions early** using that issue
* Browse [**previously posted questions**](https://github.com/Azure/Cloud-Native/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22ask+the+expert%22+) to reduce duplication. 
* Upvote (üëçüèΩ) existing questions of interest to **help us prioritize them** for the live show.

Doing this will help us all in a few ways:
 * We can ensure that _all_ questions get answered here, even if we run out of time on the live broadcast.
 * Others can vote (üëçüèΩ) on your question - helping us prioritize them live based on popularity
 * We can update them with responses post-event for future readers.
