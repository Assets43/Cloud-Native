# Roadmap for #30Days

---

## Welcome! 

This is a tentative roadmap for #30DaysOfServerless, a daily content series planned for the upcoming **Serverless September** project. It's a month-long celebration of [Serverless On Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/solutions/serverless/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) with a curated journey that takes you from understanding core technologies to developing solutions for end-to-end scenarios - organized into 4 stages:

 * **Go Serverless** with Azure Functions
 * **Deploy Microservices** with Azure Container Apps
 * **Simplify Integrations** with Azure Event Grid & Logic Apps
 * **Build End-to-End Solutions** using familiar Dev Tools & Languages


:::warning ðŸš¨ SEP 08: CHANGE IN PUBLISHING SCHEDULE

Starting from Week 2 (Sep 8), we'll be publishing blog posts in _batches_ rather than on a daily basis, so you can read a series of related posts together. _Don't want to miss updates?_ Just [subscribe to the feed](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/blog/rss.xml)

## Azure Container Apps

_Welcome to Week 2. You've learnt how to build event-driven serverless backends using Azure Functions. But how can you orchestrate and scale more complex solutions? The answer lies in microservice architectures and containerized apps. This week we explore Azure Container Apps (ACA) - and learn how the Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr) technology can work alongside ACA to unlock richer capabilities and simplify developer experience._
