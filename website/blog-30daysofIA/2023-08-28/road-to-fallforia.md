September is almost here - and that can only mean one thing!! It's time to **build intelligent apps** and spend a few weeks skilling up on relevant tools, techologies and solutions!! 

Last year, we focused on #ServerlessSeptember. This year, we're building on that theme with the addition of cloud-scale **Data**, cloud-native **Technologies** and cloud-based **AI** integrations to help you modernize and build intelligent apps for the enterprise!

Watch this space - and join us in September to learn more!
