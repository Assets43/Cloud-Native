It's hard to believe that JavaScript on Azure hack-together is ending! It seems like just yesterday that we launched this initiative, and yet here we are, 15 days later, with an incredible amount of learning and growth behind us. So... it's time for a wrap!

From the bottom of our hearts, we want to thank each and every one of you for your participation, engagement, and enthusiasm. It's been truly inspiring to see the passion and dedication from this strong community, and we're honored to be a part of it. ‚ú®

## Recap of The [JavaScript on Azure Global Hack-Together](https://aka.ms/JavaScripton_Azure)

As we wrap up this exciting event, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on all that we've accomplished together. Over the last 15 days, we've covered a lot of ground, from the basics of contributing to Open source to the exploration of the Contoso Real Estate project from its Frontend to its Backend and future AI implementation.   

Now that the hack-together is ending, we want to make sure that you have all the resources you need to continue honing your skills in the future. Whether you're looking to make your fist contribution to open source, become an open source maintainers, collaborate with others, or simply keep learning, there are plenty of resources out there to help you achieve your goals. So, let's dive in and explore all the ways you can continue to grow your JavaScript skills on Azure!
