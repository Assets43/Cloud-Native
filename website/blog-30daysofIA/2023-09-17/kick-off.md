## #30Days Of Intelligent Apps

[#30DaysOfIA](https://aka.ms/fallforIA/30days) is a series of daily blog posts grouped into themed weeks - taking you from core concepts to end-to-end solution examples in 30 days. Each article will provide conceptual lessons paired with exercises and resources to help you reinforce learnings and take next steps.

This series takes you through learning journey in‚ÄØ**four stages**, each building on the previous week to help you skill up in a beginner-friendly way:

 * **Week 1**: Power of [Intelligent Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/build-next-generation-ai-powered-applications-on-microsoft-azure/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 * **Week 2:** How to build intelligent apps with [cloud-native](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/cloud-native-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)?
 * **Week 3:** Powering intelligent applications using [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 * **Week 4:** Building a Serverless Intelligent App with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi&pivots=programming-language-csharp) and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 * **Week 5:** Build end to end AI powered solutions with real world [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)
 * **Week 6:** Build your own [Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/copilot/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi)

We will start with defining intelligent apps and then expand on how to build with cloud-native technologies like [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi) and [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi), and take you through end-to-end scenarios for real world application development. Before we dive deep on intelligent apps, here is a high-level overview of the **Intelligent Apps** landscape on Azure:
