## #60Days Of Intelligent Apps

[#60Days of IA](https://aka.ms/build-ia/60days) is a series of blog posts grouped into themed weeks - taking you from core concepts to end-to-end solution examples in 60 days. Each blog will provide conceptual lessons paired with exercises and resources to help you reinforce learnings and take next steps.

This series takes you through learning journey in **eight stages**, each building on the previous week to help you skill up in a beginner-friendly way:

* **Week 1**: Power of [Intelligent Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/build-next-generation-ai-powered-applications-on-microsoft-azure/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs)
* **Week 2**: [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) is the platform of choice for intelligent apps
* **Week 3**: [Azure Cosmos DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/introduction?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) is the database of choice for intelligent apps
* **Week 4**: [Azure AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/ai-services-and-ecosystem?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) is your choice for [Responsible AI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs)

We will start with defining intelligent apps and then expand on how to build with cloud-native technologies like [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi&ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs), [Azure Container Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/container-apps/?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi&?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) and [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/functions?WT.mc_id=javascript-99907-ninarasi&?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs), as well as integrate AI and cloud-scale data. You will learn how to build end-to-end scenarios for real world application development based on [reference architectures](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/??ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs). Before we dive deep on intelligent apps, here is a high-level overview of the **Intelligent Apps** landscape on Azure for you to leverage the most comprehensive, trusted cloud to prime the customer and employee experiences.
