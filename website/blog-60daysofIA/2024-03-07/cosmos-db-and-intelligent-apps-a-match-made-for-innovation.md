## Cosmos DB and Intelligent Apps: A Match Made for Innovation

Intelligent Apps represent the next frontier in application development. Merging machine learning (ML), data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), Intelligent Apps help drive and automate informed decisions within everyday workflows. These applications can offer predictive insights and personalized experiences by understanding user intent, making predictions, and automating tasks.

The core of Intelligent Apps lies in their ability to harness vast amounts of data, analyze it for patterns, and use these insights to improve decision-making processes, enhance user experiences, and streamline operations.

[Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cosmos-db?ocid=buildia24_60days_blogs) plays an instrumental role in building these advanced applications. Its scalability, multi-model support, and seamless integration with Azure AI Services make it a solid foundation for Intelligent Apps. Using Cosmos DB, you can manage and analyze large volumes of diverse data worldwide with minimal latency, ensuring the apps you build are intelligent, highly responsive, and globally available. Moreover, the service’s ability to handle real-time data updates and queries empowers Intelligent Apps to deliver dynamic, up-to-the-minute insights and actions.

Our three-part series demonstrates how to use Cosmos DB alongside Azure AI Services to create an Intelligent App that forecasts price fluctuations based on historical pricing and product data. In completing this series, you’ll learn why Cosmos DB is an ideal choice for powering such applications—and how it makes building Intelligent Apps accessible and approachable.

Join us as we embark on this journey to unlock the potential of Intelligent Apps with Cosmos DB!

### Building an Intelligent Forecasting Demo for E-Commerce

In the competitive e-commerce landscape, the ability to adapt pricing in real time based on demand and historical data is a valuable asset. So, this project focuses on developing a forecasting model that leverages AI/ML capabilities to predict future price changes. By integrating this model into your projects, you can enhance your applications with data-driven decision-making tools that respond effectively to market trends.

At the heart of this project is Azure Cosmos DB, chosen for its robust data management and analysis features. Cosmos DB facilitates the handling of large datasets required for accurate forecasting, providing a scalable, globally distributed database environment that supports real-time updates and queries. This capability is crucial for applying AI algorithms to historical price data, enabling the app to generate timely predictions that can inform pricing strategies.

### Laying the Groundwork with Cosmos DB

[Part 1 of our series](https://azure.github.io/Cloud-Native/60DaysOfIA/dynamic-repricing-of-products-using-intelligent-apps-part-1) starts with the foundation: setting up an Azure Cosmos DB environment tailored for the intelligent forecasting application. We’ll guide you through the initial steps of creating and configuring your Cosmos DB instance to ensure it’s ready to handle the complexities of historical pricing data.

This installment reviews how to populate your database with relevant data that will serve as the backbone for the dynamic repricing model. Once the Cosmos DB environment is established and filled with historical pricing data, you’ll be in a strong position to start leveraging Azure AI Services to analyze this data and predict future price trends.

But the first article isn’t just about setting up a database: It’s about preparing the stage for a sophisticated application that can dynamically adjust e-commerce prices. Through this exercise, you’ll learn the importance of a well-structured data foundation and how it enables the creation of more responsive and intelligent e-commerce platforms.

### Analyzing Data with Azure AI Services

In part 2 of this series, the spotlight turns to Azure AI Services. You’ll explore how to harness Azure’s powerful AI capabilities to sift through the dataset, identifying patterns and trends that are key to understanding future price fluctuations.

This stage is all about bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights, demonstrating how to apply AI capabilities to accurately forecast prices. We’ll walk step-by-step through integrating Azure AI Services with Cosmos DB, helping you create a seamless workflow that brings the dynamic repricing model to life.

This hands-on exploration will equip you with the skills to implement intelligent forecasting within your own e-commerce platforms—something that helps you make data-driven decisions on inventory pricing. By the end of part 2, you’ll have a fully operational forecasting model capable of predicting price trends based on historical data.

### Building the Web Interface

In part 3 of this series, you’ll create a simple, yet effective web interface for the Intelligent App. This interface will serve as the window through which you can easily view and interact with the results of the dynamic repricing tool. We’ll guide you through the development process, showcasing how to use popular web technologies to build an interface.

This web interface is critical in making the Intelligent App not just a powerful analytical tool but also a practical solution for e-commerce businesses. By providing a clear and intuitive way to access and understand the pricing forecasts, you can efficiently make informed decisions about pricing.

This final piece of the series ties together all the components of the project and highlights the importance of user experience in the deployment of Intelligent Apps.
